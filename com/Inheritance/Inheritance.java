/*
Types of inheritance:
1) single inheritance => one class extends another class and only class
2) multilevel inheritance => Box -> BoxWeight -> BoxPrice
3) multiple Inheritance => One class extending more than one classes i.e. 1 child class with more than 1 parent
 e.g. A & B are parent to C. But the ambiguity arises when both A & B has same member say 'n' and C tries to call it.
    So, java doesn't support multiple inheritance but what about when we really need this?
    For that, java has the concept of interference.
4) Hierarchical Inheritance => more than 1 child classes have the same parent class. The properties goes the same to
    that of single and multilevel inheritance i.e. classes inherit properties of classes above it only.
5) Hybrid Inheritance => combination of single and multiple inheritance. Not in java(check in interfaces)
